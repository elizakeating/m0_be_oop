# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - I definitely struggled towards the end with just the sheer amount I was putting together to get the result I wanted, so it got a bit overwhelming. I just need to break it down in smaller chunks than I currently do to help with that issue.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I am having no issues staying focused. I am enjoying what I'm doing and have gotten rid of *most* distractions, so it is easy for me to just focus. I definitely need to take more breaks even if it's just to get up and stretch for one minute.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
   - I overcomplicate things way more than they need to be, especially right now. I think I need to just tell myself to pull it back a bit if I feel like I'm adding layers that don't need to be there, and try to start from a more simple process.
